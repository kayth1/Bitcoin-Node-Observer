# NodeObserver
Bitcoin Node Observer is an Android app (written in Kotlin) which let you observe any public reachable node and get notified on status change (UP/DOWN). 

Currently it uses Bitnodes API to gather the current status together with plenty other information like PIX (Peer Index). 

Possible roadmap
- Direct node connection (minimize third party interaction)
- Notification if node is more than 1 block in arrears
- Notification on network issues
- Custom Properties in Node List (because most people will probably watch only one node anyway, so let them use the space for more information)

Feel free to contribute in any way.
